## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
1. Clone the repo:

```bash

```

## Usage

### Sign Up

}
```

The response will contain the JWT token

```json
{
    "token": "example_token"
}
```

### Accessing Protected Routes

To access a protected route, include the JWT token in the Authorization header

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/user
    -H "Authorization : Bearer example_token" 

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/admin
    -H "Authorization : Bearer example_token"
```
